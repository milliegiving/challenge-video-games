It took its name from the Norse deity Loki.\n\nAlthough successful in its goal of bringing games to the Linux platform, the company eventually closed due to financial troubles, with it declaring Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in August 2001 and finally being disbanded in January 2002.\n\nExcerpt from their archived website:\n\"Loki Entertainment Software contracts with successful computer entertainment software companies to port their best selling titles to Linux. A freeware Unix-like operating system, Linux has been dubbed the only true competitor to Windows and has established a solid following in the United States and abroad. Gaming software is an untapped segment of the Linux market with significant potential.\n\nUnlike commercial operating systems developed solely for profit, Linux truly represents the \"power of the people.\" Created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish developer, and made available for free over the Internet, Linux is continually being enhanced by thousands of volunteer developers and programmers around the globe. New capabilities are routinely shared and contributed as software developers have molded the versatile operating system to fit their company's specific needs. While most commercial operating systems go through five to seven revisions per year, Linux might see multiple revisions in a day. There is a virtually unlimited and growing pool of talent supporting the product.\n\nLoki Entertainment Software was founded in August, 1998 with the goal of bringing a broad range of games to Linux. Loki generates revenues for game publishers by bringing proven hits to this significant, new market. Just as Hollywood studios are able to supplement profits by re-releasing movies to video, pay-per-view and international markets, the ports developed by Loki enable publishers to generate additional revenues from existing products without incurring additional costs.\n\nFor Linux users, Loki brings best selling games, fully supported and sold through traditional retail channels -- something the Linux community has been lacking until now. We are very proud of our commitment to Linux, and are excited about bringing a rich gaming experience to our platform of choice.\"",

IO Interactive completed a management buyout, regaining their independent status and retaining the rights for Hitman and Freedom Fighters, in June 2017. \n \n- \n \nFormerly called \nASX Nr. 14.811 ApS (1990–1991) \nMermaid Invest ApS (1991–1998) \nIO Interactive ApS (1998–2000) \n \nParent company \nSquare Enix (2003–2017) \n- \n \nIt’s simple. Io-Interactive is here to deliver exciting world class entertainment, and we want our games to play and feel like the people who created them. It is our way of making sure that we will always deliver something unique and interesting. This requires not only lots of work but also lots of guts, talented people and a great working environment and we do our utmost to have all of this. \n \nWe’re doing as much as we can to make IOI feel like a second home. We meet in the morning and share breakfast, eat lunch together and party together. On Fridays we sometimes have our Friday bar – either planned as a big thing where we run around in the building with laser guns – or just spontaneously started somewhere in the building. Every now and then we have IOI days where we can dig into our pet projects or attend presentations from colleagues or external experts on everything game related. \n \nAround Christmas, we usually have the house full of all our kids making ginger bread houses and paper cuttings. In the summertime there are often football games going on and besides these three cornerstones of Denmark (food, beer and football) there’s a thing like the monthly board game night where we just go totally analogue. \n \n~ IO Interactive",

Some of it written in crayon. \n \nIn 2009, we released the open-world superhero game inFAMOUS, which rapidly turned into the summer’s must-have PS3 game, with excellent reviews and solid footing at the top of the PS3 sales charts. After launching inFAMOUS 2 in 2011, we continued the inFAMOUS franchise on PlayStation 4 in 2013 with Second Son starring Delsin Rowe and standalone DLC First Light starring Abigail ‘Fetch’ Walker. \n \nSucker Punch takes the entire 2nd floor of a skyscraper in downtown Bellevue, looking across Lake Washington to downtown Seattle. We offer a great environment, a friendly set of co-workers, a full benefits package, competitive salaries, and the opportunity to work with one of the best teams around. We’re proud of the games we’ve built, but we’re always looking to get better. We’re excited about strengthening our team with people that share our passion for building visually arresting, emotionally compelling, viscerally involving games.",

It was founded in 2009 by Amir Rao and Gavin Simon, and currently consists of employees in San Jose and other locations. Several of its team members were former developers from the Electronic Arts Los Angeles studio, which developed the Command &amp; Conquer series of video games.\n\nTheir first game, Bastion, received high critical praise, including being listed among several \"Game of the Year\" lists from game journalists. It was first shown in mid-development at the 2010 Penny Arcade Expo as part of its \"PAX 10\" highlight ten upcoming independently developed games. This attracted several publishers who wanted to help distribute the game, but Supergiant Games found that Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment shared the same vision they had for the game. Supergiant selected them as their publishing partner, enabling them not only to distribute the game to Xbox Live Arcade but as a premiere title during the 2011 \"Summer of Arcade\" promotion.\n\nIn March 2013, Supergiant Games announced their next title, Transistor, released on May 20 2014. A promotion video was released March 19. The game features a female protagonist, Red, in a cyberpunk-like city, who had gained possession of a powerful weapon that she is nearly killed for possessing. The game features a similar isometric viewpoint to Bastion. Transistor was similarly met with critical acclaim with an average critic score of 83 on Metacritic.",

    "description": "Piranha Bytes are developers of computer games located in the Ruhrgebiet, Germany’s industrial heartland. They have developed the much acclaimed GOTHIC® (publisher: Shoebox and JoWooD) and Risen® (publisher: Deep Silver) computer roleplaying series.\n\nPluto 13 GmbH was founded in 2002 by employees and management of Piranha Bytes Software GmbH. Piranha Bytes Software GmbH was itself founded in 1997 and later (1999) turned into a 100% subsidiary of Phenomedia AG, a company listed on Germany’s Neuer Markt stock exchange. In 2001 the first GOTHIC game was released to the public. In May 2002 Phenomedia AG went into insolvency proceedings due to irregularities for which several former group managers (not Piranha Bytes’ management!) have been tried for in a German criminal court of law.\n\nIt was therefore decided to make a clean cut and negotiate an MBO with the administrator, which was concluded in September 2002. Pluto 13 GmbH was founded and major assets, trademarks and most staff were transferred to the new company. One of the four original founders remained with the team in a leading position.\n\nPluto 13 GmbH is a privately owned limited liability corporation under German law, all shares are held by staff and management. Current (2013) permanent staff is around 20 people - all but of one doing active development (designers, programmers, scripters, artists...).",
